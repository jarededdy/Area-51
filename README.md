# Area-51
This is a place for me to explore my imagination using technology. By combining my intelligence with my computer's processing speed, anything is possible. 

### A Note From The Creator
The things I make here may never find completion. I may lose interest in a project and that's just life. You should feel free to fork my work and finish what I started. I'd be honored to have my creations helping the world long after I'm gone. I leave you with my all time favorite inspirational quote. Find your genius people:

>“Everybody is a genius. But if you judge a fish by its ability to climb a tree, it will live its whole life believing that it is stupid.” - Albert Einstein
